# Elev8 Flight Controller

This is the home of the Parallax Elev-8 Flight Controller, an open-source multi-rotor controller.
It was designed from the start to be an open system, allowing users to learn, experiment, and add their own code.

The firmware for the flight controller written in C/C++, and is in the
[Firmware-C](https://github.com/parallaxinc/Flight-Controller/tree/master/Firmware-C) folder.  The companion
application for changing the settings and calibrating the flight controller, called GroundStation, is in
the [GroundStation-Qt](https://github.com/parallaxinc/Flight-Controller/tree/master/GroundStation-Qt) folder.
